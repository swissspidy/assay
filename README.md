# Assay

Compiled outcome verification for web agent tasks.

Did the agent actually do what it was asked? Asking a model to judge every run is slow, costs money
and can be talked into a pass by a page that only claims success. Assay asks a model once, when you
author the task: it compiles the task into checks, which are plain JSON. The checks then run against
an evidence snapshot of the page in milliseconds, with no model. A check returns **pass**, **fail**
or **abstain**. Abstain means it could not find or read its evidence; only then does Assay escalate
to an agentic verifier.

## Install

```sh
npm install -D @swissspidy/assay @playwright/test
```

Requires Node.js 24 or later. Models are only needed to compile checks and to escalate; for those,
also install [`@anthropic-ai/sdk`](#model-providers) or the [Vercel AI SDK](#model-providers).
Releases: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

In a Playwright test:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { test, expectOutcome } from '@swissspidy/assay/playwright';

const checks = JSON.parse(readFileSync('checks/express-order.checks.json', 'utf8'));

test('agent ordered with express shipping', async ({ page }) => {
  await runMyAgent(page, 'Order what is in my cart with express shipping.');
  // The `test` fixture records the network from the start of the test. expectOutcome captures a
  // snapshot and runs the checks, polling until the expected verdict (success) or the timeout.
  await expectOutcome(page, checks, {
    probes: { latestOrder: () => page.request.get('/api/orders/latest').then((r) => r.json()) },
  });
});
```

Offline, against a stored snapshot:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { formatOutcome, loadSnapshot, verify } from '@swissspidy/assay';

const checks = JSON.parse(readFileSync('checks/express-order.checks.json', 'utf8'));
const { outcome } = await verify(checks, loadSnapshot(readFileSync('snapshot.json', 'utf8')));
console.log(formatOutcome(outcome));
```

`verify` validates the check set first and throws `CheckSetError` if it is invalid. `evaluate` is
the same check run without validation or a record, for hot loops.

## Concepts

- **Evidence snapshot.** What a run left behind: the accessibility tree, visible text, URL, network
  log, storage and the results of backend probes you define. Captured with `captureSnapshot` (or by
  `expectOutcome`), stored as JSON, and evaluated the same way live or offline.
- **Requirements and checks.** A check set lists requirements, each quoting the task text it comes
  from, and checks, each tracing to one requirement:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "C1",
    "requirement": "R1",
    "description": "The 'Cart total' output shows US$21.50 (to the cent).",
    "assert": {
      "kind": "value",
      "source": {
        "from": "node",
        "field": "text",
        "target": { "anchors": [{ "role": "status", "name": "Cart total" }] }
      },
      "normalize": [{ "op": "currency", "locale": "en-US", "currency": "USD" }],
      "expect": { "approx": { "value": { "amount": 21.5, "currency": "USD" }, "abs": 0.005 } }
    }
  }
  ```

  Assertion kinds: `state`, `contains`, `value` (read from a node, text, the URL, a request or
  response, storage or a probe, then normalized and compared), `url`, `request`, and `allOf`/`anyOf`.
  The JSON Schema is exported as `checkSetSchema`; `validateCheckSet` adds semantic checks.

- **Pass, fail, abstain.** Checks combine with three-valued logic. A requirement passes when its
  checks pass; the run succeeds when every hard requirement passes. Abstain is never turned into a
  pass or a fail silently.
- **Escalation.** Requirements the checks abstained on can go to an agentic verifier, which explores
  the snapshot (and, live, the page) with read-only tools and must cite what it observed.

A report for a page that only _claims_ an order was placed:

```
Verdict: FAIL  (tiny-shop/express-order v1, snapshot sha256:2f7375b64494…)
✘ [hard] R1: An order is placed
    ✘ C1: POST /api/orders returned 201 with status 'placed'.
        fail: 0 request(s) match POST, path /api/orders, status 201, response body matching schema (expected at least 1)
? [hard] R2: The order ships express  (value_unavailable)
    ? C2: The placed order's shipping method is express (from the server's response).
        abstain (value_unavailable): no request matches POST, path /api/orders, status 201
✔ [soft] R3: The order confirmation is shown
    ✔ C3: The browser is on an order page, or an 'Order confirmed' heading is shown.
```

Design details: [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-evidence-snapshot-and-check-dsl.md).

## Authoring checks

1. **Compile** the task and one or more reference runs into a check set:

   ```ts
   import { compileTask } from '@swissspidy/assay/compiler';
   import { anthropicModel } from '@swissspidy/assay/models';

   const { checkSet, report } = await compileTask(
     { id: 'shop/express-order', instruction, outcomes }, // outcomes: Gherkin "Then" steps, a Markdown list or plain lines
     [{ name: 'reference', kind: 'success', snapshot }],
     { model: await anthropicModel() },
   );
   ```

   A model writes the requirements, each quoting the task. An agent then explores the reference
   snapshots and submits checks; a submission is accepted only once it validates, succeeds on every
   correct reference, does not succeed on any negative one, and accepts the stress test's valid
   variants ([ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-compiler.md)).

2. **Stress-test** a check set against edited copies of correct runs: valid variants (reordered rows,
   other number and date formats, extra fields, network noise) that must still pass, and near-miss
   mutants (wrong item, missing request, pages that only claim success) that must not
   ([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-stress-testing.md)):

   ```ts
   import { formatStressReport, stressTest } from '@swissspidy/assay/stress';

   console.log(formatStressReport(stressTest(checkSet, [{ name: 'reference', snapshot }])));
   ```

3. **Review and lock.** `reviewSheet` renders each check in plain language next to what it actually
   tests. `lockCheckSet` records who confirmed it; any later edit breaks the lock:

   ```ts
   import { lockCheckSet, reviewSheet } from '@swissspidy/assay';

   console.log(reviewSheet(checkSet));
   const locked = lockCheckSet(checkSet, 'reviewer@example.com');
   ```

## Escalation and records

```ts
import { verify } from '@swissspidy/assay';
import { anthropicModel } from '@swissspidy/assay/models';

const { outcome, record, written } = await verify(locked, snapshot, {
  verifier: await anthropicModel(), // decides only what the checks abstained on
  requireLocked: true,
  agentReport: 'I placed the order.', // recorded as agent-claimed, never evidence
  recordDir: 'assay-records',
});
```

The verifier sees only the escalated requirements, gets read-only tools, and must cite the tool
outputs it relies on; uncited verdicts are rejected. Its decisions are merged into the outcome and
marked `decidedBy: "verifier"`. The outcome record (`assay.record/v1`) keeps who decided each
requirement and on what evidence, the agent's claims labelled as claims, the verifier's
observations, and content-addressed copies of the snapshot and check set. With a `proposer` model,
a run the verifier rescued yields a recompiled check set, recorded as pending approval.

In Playwright, `expectOutcome` and `verifyPage` take the same options, and the verifier also gets
read-only live access to the page:

```ts
await expectOutcome(page, locked, { verifier, recordDir: 'assay-records' });
```

`writeOutcomeRecord(dir, result)` writes a `verify` result's record by hand. Details:
[ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-escalation-and-records.md).

## Model providers

Any object with an `id` and a `turn(request)` method is a `ModelClient`. Two adapters come with the
package:

- **Anthropic** (`@swissspidy/assay/models`, needs `@anthropic-ai/sdk`): `await anthropicModel()`
  streams requests with an explicit effort, prompt caching and server-side refusal fallbacks. It is
  what the measured numbers below use.
- **Vercel AI SDK** (`@swissspidy/assay/ai-sdk`, needs `ai` 7 or later and a provider package):
  `aiSdkModel` wraps any AI SDK language model. Each turn is one `generateText` call whose tools
  have no `execute`, so Assay's own loop still validates inputs, enforces citations and records
  cassettes ([ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-vercel-ai-sdk-adapter.md)).

  ```ts
  import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic'; // or any other AI SDK provider
  import { aiSdkModel } from '@swissspidy/assay/ai-sdk';

  const verifier = aiSdkModel(anthropic(process.env.ASSAY_MODEL!), { maxOutputTokens: 32000 });
  ```

**Cassettes** make model steps reproducible. `recordingModel(model, path)` records every turn under
a digest of the full request; `replayModel(path)` replays them without a key and fails loudly if a
request changed. Both are in `@swissspidy/assay/models`.

## How well it works

Three small example apps (`examples/tiny-shop`, `tiny-tracker`, `tiny-calendar`) provide 30 tasks
and 123 labelled runs: correct, wrong item, partial, undone, over-completion, and adversarial pages
that only claim success. Each task was compiled from one correct run; on the 93 held-out runs:

| System           | Balanced accuracy | Cost / run | Model at run time |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| compiled checks  | 1.000             | $0         | no                |
| LLM judge        | 0.927             | $0.0119    | yes               |
| agentic verifier | 0.942             | $0.0273    | yes               |

The LLM judge accepted 3 of 8 adversarial pages; the checks and the verifier rejected all of them.
Full results: [eval/results/compiled/REPORT.md](eval/results/compiled/REPORT.md). Against simulated
later releases of each app (renamed copy, new layout, extra API fields, a real regression), checks
written for the first release give no wrong verdict: they abstain where renamed text breaks an
anchor, and catch every regression run ([stability report](stability/results/REPORT.md),
[ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-evaluation-and-stability.md)).
